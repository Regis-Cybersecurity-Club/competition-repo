### Scripts
Member-made scripts are stored here. Please make a folder with the name of your script and put all of your bash scripts for that program in the folder.

### Tools
Tools can be added in the appropriate 'tools' directory. All tools place in this repository need to be accessible to everyone. Therefore, they cannot require a subscription to access (free trials are ok). If you are adding a tool, please take the time to create a text file to give other club members a quickstart guide to use the tool.

### Templates
Templates can be used as a basis for inject responses. These templates can range from a simple Inject Response template to an empty table to compile network information in a clear and concise manner. Please title templates appropriately.
